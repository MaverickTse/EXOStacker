# EXO Stacker for AviUtl
------------------------
by Maverick Tse, 2014

[OneDrive Download](http://1drv.ms/1tL7lP7)

## What is this?
---------------------
A small .net program that helps merging EXO files
created by AviUtl.
Note that you should only merge EXO of with the same framerate
and resolution.
Global Project settings are taken from the FIRST file on the list,
so the first EXO should be the longest one.

Again, this is merely a merger, and will not check for EXO validity.

## How to Use
-----------------
1. Use “Add” button to add exo files, or by Drag-and-Drop
2. Use “Move Up/Down” to adjust stack order
3. Click “Save” and choose a filename to save
